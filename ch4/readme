/source folder contains the Matlab code for Chapter 4.

To generate experimental results on the weather data (/datasets/weather/dataset), run /source/run_exp_weather.m. 
It generates results on both the individual sensor changes (Table 4.1) and compound sensor changes (Table 4.2). 

To generate experimental results on the UUV data (/datasets/UUV), run /source/run_exp_uuv.m. 
It generates results on both the individual sensor changes (Table 4.3) and compound sensor changes (Table 4.4).

To generate experimental results on Chapter 4.5, run /source/run_exp_many_sensor.m.

To generate experimental results on Chapter 4.6, run /source/run_exp_spatial_temporal.m.


Results are written into /results folder.

The data and code for Chapter 4.3 can be accessed at https://github.com/CRA-PRINCESS/princess (private repository).
