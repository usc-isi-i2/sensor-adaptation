/code folder contains the Matlab code for Chapter 3.

To generate experimental results on the weather data, run /code/run_exp_weather.m. It generates results on both the individual sensor failures (Table 3.1) and compound sensor failures (Table 3.2). 

To generate experimental results on the UUV data, run /code/run_exp_uuv.m. It generates results on both the individual sensor failures (Table 3.3) and compound sensor failures (Table 3.4).

Results are saved in /results folder.
