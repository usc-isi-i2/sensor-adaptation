/source folder contains the Matlab code for Chapter 3.

To generate experimental results on the weather data (/datasets/weather/dataset), run /source/run_exp_weather.m. 
It generates results on both the individual sensor failures (Table 3.1) and compound sensor failures (Table 3.2). 

To generate experimental results on the UUV data (/datasets/UUV), run /source/run_exp_uuv.m. 
It generates results on both the individual sensor failures (Table 3.3) and compound sensor failures (Table 3.4).

Results are written into /results folder.
